Welcome to the **IBM HR Analytics** project, exploring factors influencing employee attrition and performance metrics to gain insights.

## Project Overview
In this project, we analyze IBM employee data to:
- Identify factors contributing to employee attrition.
- Visualize insights on performance, tenure, and satisfaction.

## Objectives
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and prepare data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Examine critical features.
- **Visualization**: Generate insights with Python visualizations.

## Key Files
- **`IBM_HR_Analytics_EDA.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and visualization.
- **`employee_data.csv`**: Dataset with IBM employee details

## üìù **Conclusions:**

- Workers with low `JobLevel`, `MonthlyIncome`, `YearsAtCompany`, and `TotalWorkingYears` are more likely to quit their jobs.
- **Business Travel**: Workers who travel a lot are more likely to quit compared to other employees.
- **Department**: Workers in `Research & Development` are more likely to stay than those in other departments.
- **Education Field**: Workers with degrees in `Human Resources` and `Technical fields` are more likely to quit compared to employees from other fields of education.
- **Gender**: `Males` are more likely to quit.
- **Job Role**: Workers in the `Laboratory Technician`, `Sales Representative`, and `Human Resources` roles are more likely to quit compared to those in other positions.
- **Marital Status**: Workers with a `Single` marital status are more likely to quit than those who are `Married` or `Divorced`.
